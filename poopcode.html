            <h3>Wait!? What exactly is EKREM.COM</h3>
            <p>It is my website... My name is <b><u>EKREM!!!!!</u></b></p>
            <p>But in all seriousness, this is my mock up website that I am going to practice coding on. It will be my first attempt at creating an interactive website as I work on developing my HTML, CSS and Javascript skills on my journey to becoming a web developer. Thanks for clicking on my site and joining me. You now have a virus!</p>
